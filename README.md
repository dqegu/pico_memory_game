This is a memory game that I have made using the Pico

Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- Cytron maker

How to play :
The buzzer will play a sequence, you must repeat this sequence using the three buttons (GP20, 21 and 22). It gets harder each time. If you cannot remember the correct sequence then the game ends.

Score is displayed in stdout.
